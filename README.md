[Meetup Ideas On Our Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/OIJ1pH9l/meetup-ideas)

This is a programming group for people who want to learn web and mobile development. We want everyone from the beginner to the pro. Our goal is for everyone to help each other out and also find people to build cool projects with. We have weekly social coding, where we will setup people’s developer environments and talk about what we are doing with technology. We also host a monthly hack-a-thon as well. Free pizza and drinks. :) Let’s have some fun, build some cool stuff, and help new people starting building really cool stuff. P.S. If you don’t know anything don’t feel intimated, come on in.
